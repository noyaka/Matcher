Welcome to my Matcher project! This application is designed to help companies find the most qualified candidates for their job openings. With this user-friendly interface, you can easily view all available jobs and candidates and add, edit, or delete them as needed.

The matching algorithm works by comparing the skills listed by candidates with the skills required for each job. The candidates with the most relevant skills will be ranked higher, making it easy for you to find the best match for your job opening.

Adding a new skill, candidate, or job is simple - just fill out the necessary fields, including the title and required skills. You can even edit or delete existing entries as needed.

I'm excited to provide this convenient and effective tool for matching job openings with qualified candidates.

Instructions Visual Studio Code:

Install Python and SQLite extensions.
Run in terminal 'pip install django' and 'pip install psycopg2-binary'.
Make sure you have the Python and Django versions that work together.
Also, 'venv\Scripts\activate' for activate your virtual environment.
Run the app by the command 'py manage.py runserver'.

For every job or candidate insertion, fill the slug field (should be identical to the title without white-spaces (use '-' instead) and lower-cases only).
You can use the admin user: username: admin, password: admin.
